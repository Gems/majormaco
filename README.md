# majormaco

Your macbook concierge.

Majormaco formed from the word 'majordomo', that means butler or concierge.

Majormaco is faster way to sign in when you're at home.

Almost every macbook owner has WiFi network at home. And almost every macbook owner has a phone that near him all the time. Now you can use this pair (home WiFi network and bluetooth-enabled phone) as password. You never have to open any app for that — just wake your macbook up and you're in.


## Installation

Clone repository.

Go to 'majormaco' directory and run `install/install.sh`. Follow instructions from the script to setup your installation.

Happy and secure macbooking! :)
